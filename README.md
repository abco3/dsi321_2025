## Project Overview

This project is part of the **DSI321: Big Data Infrastructure** course, which focuses on building scalable data pipelines using modern tools. Our project implements a **near real-time air quality monitoring system for Bangkok**, utilizing hourly PM2.5 and AQI data collected from the Air4Thai API. The system forecasts both current and future air pollution levels, making it useful for public health awareness, urban planning, and environmental studies.

We employ a modern data architecture comprising a combination of **Prefect** (workflow orchestration), **LakeFS** (data versioning), **Streamlit** (interactive data visualization), and **Docker** (for reproducible deployment). Furthermore, we apply **ARIMA** time-series forecasting to predict air quality levels 6 hours in advance. All components are containerized for ease of deployment and reproducibility.

### Key Features:

* Real-time ingestion of AQI and PM2.5 data from Bangkok monitoring stations  
* Forecasting of **both PM2.5 and AQI values** for each station using ARIMA
* Interactive dashboard to display live readings, forecasts, and pollution trends  
* Geographic visualization with AQI heatmaps across Bangkok districts  
* Fully containerized setup using Docker and Docker Compose  
* Reproducible and version-controlled data pipelines using LakeFS  
* Automated scheduling of ingestion and forecasting flows using Prefect  

## Tools & Technologies

| Column       | Data Type | Description |
|--------------|-----------|-------------|
| `timestamp`  | datetime  | Timestamp of the measurement |
| `stationID`  | string    | Unique station identifier |

| `PM25.value` | float     | PM2.5 concentration (µg/m³) |

## Dataset Quality Assurance

To ensure the reliability and accuracy of the dataset used in this project, we applied a comprehensive set of quality checks. These checks help maintain data integrity for both ingestion and forecasting workflows, especially when dealing with real-time air quality data from various stations.

- A minimum of **1,000 records** across all stations  
- At least **24 hours of continuous data per station**  
- More than **90% completeness** across all fields
- No columns with **`object` dtype** in the dataset  
- No **duplicated rows** for any station  

**Full Quality Check Details**

## Getting Started

Follow the steps below to set up and run the Near Real-Time Air Quality Dashboard for Bangkok:

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/abco3/dsi321_2025.git
cd dsi321_2025
```

### 2. Launch All Services with Docker

Ensure Docker is running, then start all containers:

```bash
docker-compose up --build -d
```

### 3. Access Local Services

Once the containers are up and running, access the following services via your browser:

- **LakeFS**: http://localhost:8001
- **JupyterLab**: http://localhost:8888
- **Prefect**: http://localhost:4200
- **Streamlit**: http://localhost:8501                                     

**Default login for LakeFS**: 

Username: `access_key`    
Password: `secret_key`

**Before proceeding**, create a LakeFS repository (one-time setup):

```bash
lakectl repo create lakefs://dust-concentration
```

### 4. Upload Initial Data to LakeFS (Required Before Forecasting & Dashboard)

You’ll need to upload initial `.parquet` data into LakeFS so that the dashboard and forecast pipelines can function properly.

First, open a shell inside the Jupyter container:

```bash
docker exec -it dsi321_2025-jupyter-1 bash

```

Then, run the upload script:

```bash
python myflow/upload.py
```

This script will:
- Locate the most recent folder inside `/home/jovyan/data/data.parquet/year=*/month=*/day=*/`
- Upload the latest day's `.parquet` files to the `dust-concentration` repository in LakeFS
- Overwrite existing files if necessary

### 5. Generate Initial Forecast Data (Required for Dashboard)

Before the dashboard can display forecast data, ensure LakeFS contains both real-time and forecasted datasets.

#### Option A: Run Scripts Manually via CLI

Enter the Jupyter container shell:

```bash
docker exec -it dsi321_2025-jupyter-1 bash
```

Then run the necessary scripts:

```bash
python myflow/flow.py
python myflow/forecast.py
```

#### Option B: Trigger Flows from the Prefect UI

If you have already deployed the flows using `deploy.py` and `deploy_ml.py`, you can also trigger them manually from the Prefect UI.

Navigate to [http://localhost:4200](http://localhost:4200), select each flow, and click **"Quick Run"** to execute.

### 6. (Optional) Schedule Flows with Prefect

You can automate the ingestion and forecasting flows to run every hour using Prefect.

#### Deploy the Ingestion Flow (runs at minute 25 every hour)

Enter the Jupyter container shell:

```bash
docker exec -it dsi321_2025-jupyter-1 bash
```

Then run this script:

```bash
python myflow/deploy.py
```

#### Deploy the Forecasting Flow (runs at minute 27 every hour)

Enter the Jupyter container shell:

```bash
docker exec -it dsi321_2025-jupyter-1 bash
```

Then run this script:

```bash
python myflow/deploy_ml.py
```

> These flows will execute automatically every hour if the Prefect Worker is active and new data is available in LakeFS.

## Streamlit Dashboard Overview

![Dashboard Demo](img/dashboard_demo.png)

The dashboard provides a city-wide overview of real-time and forecasted air quality in Bangkok.

### Components:

- **Station Selector**: Choose a station to view details
- **Real-time Scorecard**: Latest AQI and PM2.5 for selected station
- **Citywide Averages**: Average AQI and PM2.5 across all stations
- **Color Map**: Map of AQI levels with color-coded bubbles
- **Line Chart**: AQI Line Chart for the most polluted station
- **Forecast Line Chart**: Multi-station forecast for AQI and PM2.5
- **Data Table**: All current readings from every station

## Forecasting Logic (ARIMA)

We forecast **both AQI and PM2.5** values for each station using manually configured ARIMA models (`order=(1, 0, 1)`), implemented with the `statsmodels` package. Forecasts are generated hourly and stored in LakeFS:

```
lakefs://dust-concentration/main/forecast/forecast.parquet
```

### Key Points:

- Forecast horizon: 6 hours into the future per station  
- Separate ARIMA(1,0,1) models are trained for both PM2.5 and AQI  
- Stations with fewer than 24 hourly records are skipped  
- Outlier stations (e.g., with constant data) are excluded  
- Forecasts are rounded (AQI) or kept as float (PM2.5) and saved back to LakeFS  
- Forecast results are visualized in the Streamlit dashboard
